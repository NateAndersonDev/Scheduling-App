How to run the program:
User should execute the program- calling the main method in the Main package.

The user should then enter their username and password into the text fields and click the "login" button. If the user does not have an account in the database they can use "test" for a username, and "test" for the password, provided the database contains a user that matches these values. 

The user will be presented with a message informing them of whether there is an appointment occurring within 15min of their local time. After acknowledging this message, the user can select an appoint to edit from the table, using the text fields on the left side of the application window to set the associated values. If the user wants to save a change, they can click the save button, or if a new appointment is to be added the "Add new Appointment" button can be clicked to allow the generation of a new appointment.
Two separate reports can be generated through the combo boxes and "get results" buttons near the bottom of the page, and filters of the table can be seen at the top of the page, facilitated through radio buttons. There are also three additional buttons towards the top right of the page,
which will direct the user to the other pages or exit the application page. The "View contact's Schedule" button will facilitate the user in viewing different contact's schedules by name, and the "Modify Customer Form button" will direct the user to a window where they can modify, add new, or delete existing customers. 
To exit the application the Exit button can be clicked, or the window closed through the clicking of the "X" symbol at the top right of the window page. 
The additional report for part A3f consists of returning the number of matching appointments that exist for a user (by id) and the appointment type.
