    WRITE SOME FUNCTION TO GET CONTACT NAME FROM CONTACT ID

    Function that takes First and Second level country data and turn it into a Division ID & Vice Versa.

    Functions that converts between all the timezones. UTC -> Local, UTC -> Eastern, System -> UTC etc.
    This will save you lots of time and headache. Make these, test these and you will save the hardest part of your project.
    Use LocalDateTime objects and ZoneIDâ€™s to do this. There are resources online.
